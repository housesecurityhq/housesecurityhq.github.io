<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
