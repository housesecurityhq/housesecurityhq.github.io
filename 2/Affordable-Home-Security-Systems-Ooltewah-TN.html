<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall.
