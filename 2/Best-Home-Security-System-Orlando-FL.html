<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is an excellent security camera and a remarkable value. It receives an Excellent ranking for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership prepare for extra cloud storage.

(You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more costly overall per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't recommend it because its battery-saving regimens can disrupt efficiency.</p>
