<p>After testing lots of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.
