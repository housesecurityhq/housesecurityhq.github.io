Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
