<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
