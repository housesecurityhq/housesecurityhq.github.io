Some systems store recorded video locally on an SD card or a strong state drive, while others offer cloud storage. In your area saved video is a good option for do-it-yourselfers on a budget plan, but you need to be careful not to overwrite video you may need later on. Cloud storage makes it easy to store and access tape-recorded video, however it can cost numerous dollars each year depending upon your subscription. Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some supply a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR abilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it simple to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time.</p>
