<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently gone through extensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following further grievances, two weeks later on a new professional was sent who suggested there would be considerable added fees to complete the installation.</p>
