<p>Most of the cameras we checked require an AC outlet, so placement is certainly an element. A few designs use batteries, making positioning more versatile, however this needs other trade-offs, which we highlight in the Competition area.

We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a minimal field of view, and Wyze states it prepares to do away with individual detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>

<p>Bullet cameras are among the 2 most common CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, providing their name and a distinctive look. This appearance is identifiable to almost everyone and thus serves as a deterrent to unwanted individuals. The hope is wrongdoers and burglars go in other places instead if security cameras are visible. That being stated, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism since of their apparent look.
