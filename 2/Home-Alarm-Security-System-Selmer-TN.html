<p>On the installation date, a single professional arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The manager got to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following further grievances, two weeks later a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be significant added fees to complete the installation.</p>
