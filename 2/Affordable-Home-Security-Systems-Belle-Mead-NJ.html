<p>All About Security offers expert, dependable alarm monitoring services for homes and organisations throughout the greater Indianapolis area. Due to the fact that it's more complicated than it ought to be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
