<p>While the convenience of wirefree installation is factor enough for numerous homeowners and tenants to opt for wireless systems, some users might discover changing rechargeable batteries a tedious chore-a concern mostly removed by the latest alternatives, such as Blink Indoor Home Security System, which includes a two-year battery life. ADT offers both landline and cellular monitoring. Landline monitoring might seem old-fashioned, but if you don't have trusted cell service in your area, it's the best choice.
