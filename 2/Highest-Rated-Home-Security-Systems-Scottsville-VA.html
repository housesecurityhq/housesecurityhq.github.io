<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. If catching footage in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>

<p>On the installation date, a single service technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following additional grievances, 2 weeks later on a new technician was sent who indicated there would be considerable surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
