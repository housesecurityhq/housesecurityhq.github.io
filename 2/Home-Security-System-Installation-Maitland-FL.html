<p>What lots of people do not understand is that there is another class of security camera that is straight offered to the general public, though not discovered in the big box and warehouse stores. These surveillance cameras are classified as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the kind of camera utilized by these huge box chains to secure their stock. Take a look at the ceiling of customer electronic devices stores and warehouse chains and you will notice in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the typical customer camera. Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even use the type of cameras they are offering to the general public, and there is a good reason.</p>

It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment prices is super affordable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
