<h3>Hidden Cameras - The CBI Surveillance For Your Residence in Oak Creek WI 53154</h3>
<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge a violation. As soon as a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
