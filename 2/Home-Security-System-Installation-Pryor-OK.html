<h3>Goodbye Webcams, Hello Wireless Internet Camera in Pryor OK 74361</h3>
<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
