<p>Bullet cameras are one of the two most typical CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, providing their name and an unique appearance. This appearance is identifiable to almost everybody and therefore serves as a deterrent to unwanted individuals. If security cameras are visible, the hope is bad guys and intruders go somewhere else instead. That being said, bullet cameras are more vulnerable to vandalism because of their obvious look. Furthermore, the shape of the camera is ideal for focusing on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but needs numerous cameras if a user needs to see numerous fixed views. Bullet cameras are quickly mountable and can work indoors or outdoors. They include a small lip on completion of the camera that includes weather condition protection and decreases glare.</p>
