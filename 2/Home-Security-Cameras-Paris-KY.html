<p>While it strikes the resolution, we think there's a little interpolation on its 4K video given that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, however this is still by far the sharpest security camera we have actually seen in action, wireless or otherwise. In cities with low robbery rates, security systems with less elements and without expert monitoring are more practical options.

<p>I have actually had their doorbell for a year - never a concern. And their cameras are better priced than any others. Free and subscription-based cloud video storage. What's not to love about the Arlo Ultra? This camera takes cutting edge to new heights and features a ton of key features we haven't seen in a single video camera (or at all) before.

Still, it's compatible with Alexa and apps on iOS or Android.</p>
