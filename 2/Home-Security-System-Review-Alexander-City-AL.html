<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following more complaints, two weeks later a new technician was sent who showed there would be considerable additional charges to finish the installation.</p>

Moreover, there is periodically up to an hour delay in receiving alerts on your phone from the Nest Guard, a concerning concern.

<p>The greatest downside of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets triggered while you're away, you have no visual methods of validating if something is really incorrect and how major the circumstance is. If the alarm event is identified to be a false alarm, the city will send by mail an invoice summarizing the incident and evaluating a charge, if any.</p>
