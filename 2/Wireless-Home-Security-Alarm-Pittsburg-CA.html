<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
