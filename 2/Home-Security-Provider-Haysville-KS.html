The caught digital video stream is then relayed over a local area network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be established to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set amount of time, typically one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of dedicating to a long-term plan, are ending up being more common. These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement.
