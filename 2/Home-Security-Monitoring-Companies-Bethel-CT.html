<h4>Wireless Security Camera System Bethel 06801</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently undergone comprehensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following more problems, 2 weeks later on a new technician was sent who showed there would be significant surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
