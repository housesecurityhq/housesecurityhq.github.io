<h4>Home Video Surveillance Rogersville 35652</h4>
<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights at night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of an issue is between tape-recording and spotting motion. Since the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to actually turn on when it discovers motion. They could get past the camera before it had time to tape-record them if a wicked crook was fast enough.</p>
<p>Because Seattle's false alarm charges are so high for alarm companies, Frontpoint likewise provides validated response services. This isn't the norm for Frontpoint, as they just use this service in select cities. In Seattle, they'll send a contract security guard to your home if preferred.
