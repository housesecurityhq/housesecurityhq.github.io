<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
