<h4>Alarm Security System Companies Hickory Hills 60457</h4>
<p>Figure 1-1 depicts an example of a CCTV installation that keeps an eye on select areas of protection. The first installation was developed and established for the separate parking center. This implementation included a number of fixed position cameras on each flooring of the parking lot, stairwells, and exits, all connected directly to a primary control unit (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is a simple device for managing the input and output of video feeds through the coax cable televisions.
