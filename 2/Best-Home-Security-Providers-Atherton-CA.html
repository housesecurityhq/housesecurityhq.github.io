<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
