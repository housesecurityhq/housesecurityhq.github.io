<p>When selecting a security camera is whether or not you want video alarm verification, another element you'll desire to keep in mind. This function is normally found with home security service providers, instead of security camera manufacturers. With video alarm confirmation, a video is normally taken and sent to your provider's monitoring center, and an agent will see the clip to confirm if the authorities need to be dispatched to your home.
