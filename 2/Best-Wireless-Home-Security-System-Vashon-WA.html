The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after practically 2 years of day, usage and night images have always been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we came across when evaluating the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion identified.
