<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
