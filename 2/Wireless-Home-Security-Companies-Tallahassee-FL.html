<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor got to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further complaints, two weeks later on a new professional was sent who suggested there would be considerable added fees to finish the installation.</p>
