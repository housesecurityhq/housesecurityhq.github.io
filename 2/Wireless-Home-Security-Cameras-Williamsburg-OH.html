<h4>Fire Alarm System Williamsburg 45176</h4>
<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
