<p>While every homeowner frets about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complicated agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often leading to false alarms. A few other companies (like Abode, nest, and ring) have no-contract systems. But SimpliSafe has lower prices and more industry experience, so it's still our preferred contract-free home security system. KEEP IN MIND: We included the cost of the SimpliCam, although there's a special today that gives you one totally free. That brings the first-year total to $553.88. Make sure to look for deals like this, as SimpliSafe offers a totally free camera quite routinely.</p>
<p>TP-Link's Kasa Cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that might match some of our top picks.

So select what will be the better deal for you. Go with the contract and reap those cost savings if you know you'll stay put for at least three years. However if you may update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
