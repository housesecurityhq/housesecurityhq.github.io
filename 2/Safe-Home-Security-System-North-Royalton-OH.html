<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
