<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you desire the best of whatever, you'll desire Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automated door lock and smart thermostat for the price of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic bundle if you can't manage the additional equipment. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay additional for).</p>
