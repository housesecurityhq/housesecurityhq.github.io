<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

Once again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, because obviously they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.
