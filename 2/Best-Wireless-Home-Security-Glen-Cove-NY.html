However, after almost 2 years of usage, night and day images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we experienced when evaluating the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
