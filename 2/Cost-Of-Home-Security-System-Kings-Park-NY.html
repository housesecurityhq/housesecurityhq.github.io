<h4>Small Business Security Systems Kings Park 11754</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had just recently undergone comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following more complaints, 2 weeks later on a new technician was sent who indicated there would be significant surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
