<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it adds individual detection, that makes for smarter smartphone signals-- and, in some cases, less false notifies. You will not have to fret about it taping or sending an alert every time the canine walks by if the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic area. (We believe this is a better function if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where cars often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's great that it's not necessary, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Web cam.</p>
