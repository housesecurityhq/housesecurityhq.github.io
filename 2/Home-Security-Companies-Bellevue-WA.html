<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
