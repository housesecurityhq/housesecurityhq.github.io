These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level.
