<p>I described that all we would require to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency button, it sends out double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

<p>When it concerns rates and contracts, Protect America is less than suitable. While the 3 plans (Copper, Silver, and Platinum) are reasonably priced for what they provide, the compulsory three-year contract and extreme policy might terrify numerous away. Additional costs like $10 for fire monitoring and $10 for video monitoring are likewise not typical for competing home security providers.</p>
