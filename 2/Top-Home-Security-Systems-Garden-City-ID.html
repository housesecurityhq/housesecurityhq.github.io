Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Being able to compare a vehicle and an individual, for example, permits you to minimize unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, and even garbage cans.</p>

The base station is curvier and the sensors are smaller sized, but the variety is much better, promising connections to wireless sensors as much as 800 feet away.
