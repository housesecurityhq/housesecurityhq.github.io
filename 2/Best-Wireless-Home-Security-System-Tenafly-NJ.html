<p>I have this camera hooked up to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter signals, for example.

Similar to their indoor equivalents, outdoor cameras connect to your Wi-Fi network and permit you to view live video from your phone. They are fairly simple to install, but if you're comfortable or not familiar with electrical circuitry, you may want to have a professional electrical expert do the job.</p>
