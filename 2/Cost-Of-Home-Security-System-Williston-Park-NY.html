After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
