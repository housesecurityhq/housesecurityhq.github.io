<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
