<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
