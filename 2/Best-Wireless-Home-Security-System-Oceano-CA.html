<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are 3 times more likely to be robbed.

In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if required, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
