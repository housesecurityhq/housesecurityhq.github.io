<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
