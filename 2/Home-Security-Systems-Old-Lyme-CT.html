<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Also unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error.

The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed.
