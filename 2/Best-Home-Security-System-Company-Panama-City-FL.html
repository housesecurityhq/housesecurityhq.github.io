<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are 3 times more likely to be robbed. A wireless system will typically include a mobile app that makes them much easier for you to monitor and manage.

<p>Another element to think about is security, a wireless connection is rather simple for hackers to gain access to.

<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you want the best of whatever, you'll desire Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automated door lock and smart thermostat for the rate of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic plan if you can't afford the additional equipment. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
