Throughout testing, we found it was basic to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was spotted. We love that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we tested and there's no external monitoring service offered.</p>
