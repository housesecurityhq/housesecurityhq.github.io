<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical because the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
