<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
