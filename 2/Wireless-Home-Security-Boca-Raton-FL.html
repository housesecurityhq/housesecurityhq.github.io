You no longer require reams of cable television, a bank of screens, or a big hard disk drive to store all the video, because whatever can be set up in minutes and handled from your phone. We love that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision choice, but the black and white version can in fact be clearer and offer you higher-quality footage. This isn't actually a huge offer considering the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- however for the record, stick with black and white.</p>

<p>Mobile phone app is useful and easy to use. One thing we actually liked was the customer-friendly policies-- like the life time service warranty on items and the rate-lock assurance for life. This shows us that the company truly cares about its users. Other than maybe Frontpoint or ADT, we normally do not see this with most companies. Lots of emergencies need immediate intervention, especially if you aren't home to hear the alarm. This is why we always suggest monitored alarm systems, particularly for individuals who aren't home at all times.</p>
<p>While it strikes the resolution, we presume there's a little interpolation on its 4K footage considered that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, but this is still far and away the sharpest security camera we have actually seen in action, wireless or otherwise. In cities with low theft rates, security systems with fewer components and without professional monitoring are more practical options.
