<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had just recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following additional grievances, two weeks later a new specialist was sent who showed there would be substantial additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
