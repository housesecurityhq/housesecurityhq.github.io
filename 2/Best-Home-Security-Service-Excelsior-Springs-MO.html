<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural merging of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single interface uses additional details that might never ever have been possible before, such as alert of a worker, by name and recognition number, entering the building.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
