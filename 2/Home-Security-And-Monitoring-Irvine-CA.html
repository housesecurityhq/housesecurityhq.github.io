<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. The loudest of the clever alarm we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at cautioning anyone in your home and those neighboring that there's a problem. Throughout screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we enjoy that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adjusted to account for family pets, too. The alarm is simply one of 2 we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're impressed that it also includes a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, even more dissuading anyone from trying to break in to your property. We evaluated Somfy's more expensive system, which featured a wifi security camera, however more budget-friendly sets are also readily available.
