<h4>Cheap Alarm System Brush Prairie 98606</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually just recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further problems, 2 weeks later a new technician was sent who indicated there would be substantial surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
