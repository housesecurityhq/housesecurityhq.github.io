<p>Not all security cameras work in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that enables more light to enter the camera's sensor.

<h4>Security Monitoring Equipment Willard 65781</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single service technician arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The manager got to 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually just recently undergone extensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following more grievances, 2 weeks later on a new professional was sent who indicated there would be significant added fees to complete the installation.</p>
