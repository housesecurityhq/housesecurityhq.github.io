It likewise does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage.
