<h4>Camera Surveillance System Monongahela 15063</h4>
<p>I have this camera connected to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights at night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
