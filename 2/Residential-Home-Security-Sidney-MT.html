Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>So, wired or wireless? Simply put, the type of security system that you require will depend upon what you're searching for.
