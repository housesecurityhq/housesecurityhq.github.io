<h4>House Alarm Service Adelanto 92301</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single service technician arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The manager reached 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually just recently undergone comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following further problems, 2 weeks later a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be considerable additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
