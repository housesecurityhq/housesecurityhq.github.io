<p>While every homeowner worries about burglaries, suspicion has actually surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complicated agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in incorrect alarms. A couple of other companies (like Ring, nest, and abode) have no-contract systems. However SimpliSafe has lower prices and more industry experience, so it's still our preferred contract-free home security system. NOTE: We added in the cost of the SimpliCam, despite the fact that there's a special today that offers you one totally free. That brings the first-year overall down to $553.88. Make sure to search for offers like this, as SimpliSafe uses a totally free camera pretty routinely.</p>
<p>I described that all we would require to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if required, might just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
