The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after nearly 2 years of day, night and usage images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we came across when testing the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion detected. We've seen it highlight moths, mice, and cars and trucks.</p>

<p>Unlike landline-based systems, wireless security systems may be at danger of disturbance and hacking. We discovered their cellular monitoring to be responsive and reliable, however it was absolutely nothing worth writing home about. However, we think you'll like Vivint's award-winning Sky App, that made it ultra-easy to access and manage our system from another location.</p>
