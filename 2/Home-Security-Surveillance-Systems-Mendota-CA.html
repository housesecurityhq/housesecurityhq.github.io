While the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides some protection against video searches conducted by the police, there are currently no general, lawfully enforceable rules to restrict privacy invasions and protect versus abuse of CCTV systems. Guidelines are required to establish a clear public understanding of such issues as whether video signals are taped, under what conditions, and for how long are they retained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be confirmed and enforced; and what punishments would apply to violators.</p>
