At the very same time, home security companies-spurned by the introduction of new competitors and the ease of a Google search revealing the level of client satisfaction in their prices and products-have made their contracts more transparent and flexible with a larger series of security services available that cater to various clients' needs and monetary scenarios.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
