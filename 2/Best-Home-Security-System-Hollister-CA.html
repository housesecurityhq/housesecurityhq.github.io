<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
