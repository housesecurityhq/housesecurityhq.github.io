<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
