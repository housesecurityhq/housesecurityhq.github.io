<p>On the installation date, a single professional arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Also disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The manager reached 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually just recently undergone extensive background checks.

Following further complaints, 2 weeks later on a new specialist was sent who showed there would be substantial added fees to finish the installation.</p>
