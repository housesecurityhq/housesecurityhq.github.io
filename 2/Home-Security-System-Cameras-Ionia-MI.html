<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
