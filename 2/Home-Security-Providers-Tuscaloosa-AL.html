The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you wish to save some cash - it does have actually a cable television connected though, rather than working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit much easier to mess up for prospective burglars. Absolutely among the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
