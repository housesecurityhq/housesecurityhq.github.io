I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
