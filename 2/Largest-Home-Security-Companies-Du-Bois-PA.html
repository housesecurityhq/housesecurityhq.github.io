<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was blended.

We updated to wireless security and he was extremely patient as he described how to include the app to our phones, and provided me a very well done personal training session on the information of the Safe Touch home page.
