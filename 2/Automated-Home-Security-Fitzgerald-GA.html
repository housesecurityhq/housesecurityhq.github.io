<p>Unlike standard burglar alarms, which have a control panel (typically positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to disarm the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensing units have actually been triggered, smart alarms are managed from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and alerts you if any of the sensors have been set off, rather than getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially annoying your neighbours). However, smart alarms do require a hub that enables the various components to wirelessly connect. However for a lot of smart alarms this hub can be placed anywhere in your home.</p>
