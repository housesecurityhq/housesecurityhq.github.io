<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras minimize criminal activity. There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving things if it finds an intruder; a handy intercom function that enables the device to serve as a wise doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, given that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>
<p>A couple of minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply would not connect.

Definitely not perfect-- however the associate apologized and shipped her replacement control panel over night.</p>
