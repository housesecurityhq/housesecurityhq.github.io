<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
