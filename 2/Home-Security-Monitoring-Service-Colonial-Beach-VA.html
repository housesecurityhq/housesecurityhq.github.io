<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
