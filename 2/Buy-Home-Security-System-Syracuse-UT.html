<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>Frontpoint uses five packages and two monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester selected the Interactive strategy but ended up dissatisfied with its absence of live video surveillance.
