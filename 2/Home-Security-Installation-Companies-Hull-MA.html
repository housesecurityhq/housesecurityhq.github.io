Likewise unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The manager arrived at 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently gone through thorough background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following additional complaints, 2 weeks later on a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be significant additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
