<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
