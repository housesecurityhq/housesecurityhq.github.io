It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription prepare for additional cloud storage.

Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
