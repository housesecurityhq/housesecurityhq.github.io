The system can be set up to communicate by means of network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
<p>Seeing angle: The camera's field of view determines just how much it can see. As you're probably monitoring a single room, you want a large viewing angle. Most existing cameras fall in the 130-degree range. These broad angles can often cause image distortion at the edges in the type of a fisheye result, particularly when utilized in smaller spaces, but it's not like you're going to utilize a security to catch pictures for your photo album.</p>
