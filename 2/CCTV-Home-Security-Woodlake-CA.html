<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
<p>Siren Several one-box systems like Canary and Somfy feature an extremely loud integrated siren that must ideally scare off trespassers (or next door's cat). Expect to see more sirens, both indoor and out, over the coming year as the wise brand names expand their ranges. If you receive a billing for excessive incorrect alarms, you may appeal it. Initially, we suggest that you phone the Napa Authorities Department Records Division to discuss your concerns and questions. If you are disappointed with the results of this discussion, you might request an official appeal hearing.</p>
