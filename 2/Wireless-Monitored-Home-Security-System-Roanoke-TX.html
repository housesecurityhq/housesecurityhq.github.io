Itlast week went green, and would read as disconnected on the Zmodo app; however, it worked fine as a Alder Security repeater. I disconnectedit, reset it to factory default, and added it back to the Zmodo App. It is currently working fine. November 1, 2016Hands down for $80 you are not going to discover a better doorbell system and Wi Fi extender.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
