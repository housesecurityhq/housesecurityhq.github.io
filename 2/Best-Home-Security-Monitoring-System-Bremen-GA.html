However while we like the smart functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Cam IQ, a number of the cameras we looked at offer the very same advantages at a more reasonable price. Make certain to think of how your camera will continue to get power during an interruption. Lots of people choose battery-powered cameras or cameras with a rechargeable battery pack that begins working if power isn't identified as a backup source of power.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
