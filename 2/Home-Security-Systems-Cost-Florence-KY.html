<p>All About Security provides professional, reliable alarm monitoring services for homes and businesses throughout the greater Indianapolis area. The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
