<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
