<p>Pelco provides video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, centers, and hotels. There are various methods to address this questions, but we've found that it normally comes down to this: If your home is currently wired, it might be the most convenient option. If your home is not pre-wired for security, a wireless system is perfectly great. If you do have a wired system, while not important, we would advise having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send out a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>
<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency button, it sends double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if required, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
