<p>Some home insurance coverage companies require you to have an alarm system as part of their policy. Nevertheless, alarms required by insurer need to comply with the European Standard EN 50131 and should be set up by an NSI or SSAIB recognized installer.

<p>Motion sensors offer backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. But they just operate when you run out the house. Do not think they'll secure you if someone enters when you're sleeping! Rather the opposite, your alarm system in fact disregards motion sensor signals if you arm the system however stay at home.

<p>For a lot of commercial CCTV systems, structured cabling run throughout the walls, linking your security cameras to the server or NVR, will be a crucial element. While a growing number of wireless security cameras are ending up being popular, especially for home use, wired security cameras still reign supreme for more long-term and requiring security use.</p>
