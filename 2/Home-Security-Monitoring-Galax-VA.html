Likewise disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor got to 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently undergone extensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following more complaints, 2 weeks later a new professional was sent who indicated there would be considerable surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
