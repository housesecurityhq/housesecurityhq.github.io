<h4>Best Monitored Wireless Security System Huntingdon 38344</h4>
<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you want the best of whatever, you'll want Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the smart home tech.
