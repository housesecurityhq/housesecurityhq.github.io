<p>On the installation date, a single professional showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The manager reached 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following more complaints, 2 weeks later a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be substantial surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
