<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
