<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
<p>A few minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it just would not connect.

Definitely not perfect-- but the representative said sorry and shipped her replacement control panel over night.</p>
