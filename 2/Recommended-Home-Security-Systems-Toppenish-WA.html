<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

Circle 2 home security camera's selection of installs and accessories enable it to work practically anywhere, inside or outside your home.</p>
<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive overall per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option.
