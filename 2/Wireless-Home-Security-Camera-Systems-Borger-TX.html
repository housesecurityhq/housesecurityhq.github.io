<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
