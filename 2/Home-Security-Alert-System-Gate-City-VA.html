<p>On the installation date, a single service technician got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The manager came to 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently been subjected to thorough background checks.
