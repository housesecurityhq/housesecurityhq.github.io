<h4>Wireless CCTV System Harvey 70058</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following more complaints, 2 weeks later on a new technician was sent who showed there would be substantial additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
