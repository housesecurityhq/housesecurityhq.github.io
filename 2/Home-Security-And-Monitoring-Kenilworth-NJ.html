<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
