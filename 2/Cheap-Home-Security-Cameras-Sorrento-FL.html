<p>What many individuals do not understand is that there is another class of security camera that is directly offered to the general public, though not found in the big box and discount store. These surveillance cameras are categorized as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the kind of camera utilized by these huge box chains to secure their stock. Look at the ceiling of customer electronic devices shops and warehouse chains and you will see in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the typical consumer camera. Let that sink in for a minute ... these companies do not even use the type of cameras they are selling to the general public, and there is a good reason.</p>

It works either connected to power or with its built-in battery-- and it's the only Canary camera that you can utilize inside and outdoors.</p>
