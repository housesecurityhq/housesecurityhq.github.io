Due to the fact that they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality parts that can adapt and capture exceptional low light video, commercial cameras outperform their more affordable cousins.</p>
<p>It starts with connectivity. Setup of the Arlo hub and its paired camera was very quickly, and where the others might have you wait a while before reaching a live view, the Arlo gives up the goods rapidly (and when you're silencing a siren, or talking to a caller, that immediacy is invaluable).
