However I also value minimalist systems that elements that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation available to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensing unit, clever lock, and so on), I wish to make sure that they all easily interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
