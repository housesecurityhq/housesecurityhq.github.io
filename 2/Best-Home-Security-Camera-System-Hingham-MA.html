<p>The House Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a strong option for some people. Abode has updated that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which provides a much better range for sensing units. Both the original Abode system and the Abode Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we evaluated that likewise deals with HomeKit. We have actually come across a few technical concerns while long-term screening the Residence Iota, and so will continue to test and upgrade appropriately. We no longer suggest it.</p>

While the company doesn't provide rather as numerous hours of customer support as other brand names, it has a great reputation with great deals of vocal, pleased consumers.
