<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
