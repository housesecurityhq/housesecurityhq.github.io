<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
