<p>The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter signals, for instance. However, those functions come at a comparatively steep price: $5 each month ($50 per year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 per year) for thirty days of video history.
