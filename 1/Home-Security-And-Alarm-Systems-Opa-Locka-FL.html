<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
