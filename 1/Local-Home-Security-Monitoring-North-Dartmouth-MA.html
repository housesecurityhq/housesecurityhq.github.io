<p>On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't add a ton of other clever home tech to the system. It won't deal with loads of wise home equipment from other companies. The app is extremely outstanding, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, producing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you journey the motion sensing unit in the morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>The Ring Bridge is the company's smart light hub, which can support as much as 50 smart lights at the same time, enabling you to sync up the systems' wise lights with one another, as well as with cameras and video doorbells.
