<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
