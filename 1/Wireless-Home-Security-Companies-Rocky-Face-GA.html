<p>On the installation date, a single specialist got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager got to 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further grievances, two weeks later a new professional was sent who suggested there would be significant added fees to finish the installation.</p>
