<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that.
