<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
