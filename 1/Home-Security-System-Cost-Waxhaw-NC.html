<h4>Intrusion Alarm System Waxhaw 28173</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further grievances, two weeks later on a new technician was sent who indicated there would be substantial surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
