<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
