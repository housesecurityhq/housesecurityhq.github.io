<p>A 2nd video solution can be integrated into a basic panel, which sends the main station an alarm. When a signal is gotten, an experienced monitoring professional gain access to the on-site digital video recorder (DVR) through an IP link to identify the reason for the activation.

A lot of users are not very delighted with the method dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for false alarms since they can often result in added fees. Moreover, the general opinion is that the company's customer support is not extremely useful when it comes to fixing issues and repeating usage concerns.</p>

<p>The cover of darkness isn't adequate to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a bit of a problem is between taping and identifying motion. It takes a second for the camera to really turn on when it spots motion due to the fact that the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording. They might get past the camera before it had time to record them if a nefarious lawbreaker was quick enough.</p>
