<p>All About Security provides professional, trustworthy alarm monitoring services for homes and organisations throughout the higher Indianapolis area. The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
