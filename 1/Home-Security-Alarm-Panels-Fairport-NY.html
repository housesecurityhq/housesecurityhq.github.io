<p>The only method to keep communication really secure is to utilize end-to-end file encryption For instance, when accessing a web bank, one would almost always use strong file encryption from the web internet browser and all the way to the bank - hence it shouldn't be dangerous to do banking over an unencrypted wireless network. The argument is that anybody can sniff the traffic uses to wired networks too, where system administrators and possible hackers have access to the links and can check out the traffic.
