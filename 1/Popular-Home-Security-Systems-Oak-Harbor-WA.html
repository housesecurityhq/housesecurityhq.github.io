<p>On the installation date, a single professional showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Also upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently undergone thorough background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further grievances, two weeks later a new professional was sent who showed there would be substantial added fees to finish the installation.</p>
