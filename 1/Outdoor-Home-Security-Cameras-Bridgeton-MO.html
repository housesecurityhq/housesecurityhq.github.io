<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
