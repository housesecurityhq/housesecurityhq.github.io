While some components may be affected for a little while by a power failure, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electricity. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours up until the electric service is brought back. Landline systems use traditional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, just like cellular systems, they typically have a battery backup to keep them working for a set amount of time.</p>

Nevertheless, house owners with weak web shouldn't choose a WiFi-driven system considering that the signal will continue to render the security and drop system worthless.
