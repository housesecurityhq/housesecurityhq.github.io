<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
