<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular given that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
