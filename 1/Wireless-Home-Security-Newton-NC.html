Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
