<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that give access to a home's security app to as much as 20 member of the family.

In addition, officers reacting to these incorrect alarms are unable to react to actual emergencies or perform preventative patrols.</p>
<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you desire the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the clever home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and wise thermostat for the rate of equipment and $10 extra a month. If you can't pay for the extra equipment, we still like Vivint's basic package. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
