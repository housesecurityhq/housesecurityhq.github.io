Offering customers the choice of a more full-service security offering, beyond offering alarms and other gadgets a la carte, makes good sense for a number of reasons.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
