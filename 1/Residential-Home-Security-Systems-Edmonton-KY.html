<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical because the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
