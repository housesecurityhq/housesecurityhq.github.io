<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. The loudest of the wise alarm systems we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at cautioning anyone in your house and those neighboring that there's a problem.

Your alarm company might end up owing a lot of incorrect alarm costs, which they might then hand down to you.
