<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically safer, but after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel practically vulnerable. All of the systems we have actually checked feature an app that lets you utilize your smart device as your command center to arm and disarm the system, create guidelines, include and delete components, and get push notices when alarms are activated.

Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensor, window sensing unit, smart lock, etc.), I want to make certain that they all easily interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
