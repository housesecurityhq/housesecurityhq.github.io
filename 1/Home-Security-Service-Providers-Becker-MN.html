<p>Smart device app is beneficial and easy to use. Something we really liked was the customer-friendly policies-- like the lifetime guarantee on items and the rate-lock assurance for life. This shows us that the company truly cares about its users. Aside from perhaps Frontpoint or ADT, we normally don't see this with most companies. Many emergencies need instant intervention, specifically if you aren't home to hear the alarm. This is why we always recommend monitored alarm systems, specifically for individuals who aren't home at all times.</p>
