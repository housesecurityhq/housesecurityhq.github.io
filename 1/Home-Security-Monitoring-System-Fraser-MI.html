Also disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error.

The manager arrived at 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently gone through comprehensive background checks.
