<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor reached 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had recently undergone thorough background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further grievances, two weeks later a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be significant surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
