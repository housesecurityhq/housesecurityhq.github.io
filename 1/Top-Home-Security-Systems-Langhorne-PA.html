<p>4G Wireless works similar to a cellular phone. The modem links to the internet much like a cellular phone. Among the things to think about with this choice is not just is a sim card required but also a cellular modem and a switch would need to be framed in an enclosure if the camera is positioned outside, this is presuming there is a neighboring power supply if not a solar panel would be needed. Likewise keep in mind there would be a month-to-month charge for using a 4G network comparable to web, if you do not pay the bill the cameras would have no signal.
