<p>There are two parts to your home security system expenses: equipment and monitoring. It features HD live streaming, motion informs, night vision, a decent app and, most importantly, 14 days of totally free motion-based cloud storage.

<p>But for everyone who enjoys ADT, it appears like there's somebody who's had a dreadful experience. Because ADT has more clients than most brand names-- which indicates it has more opportunities to run into issues, part of that is. But part of it is the way ADT offers its equipment.

Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working.
