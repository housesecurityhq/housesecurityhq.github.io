<p>All About Security provides expert, reliable alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the greater Indianapolis area. The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>

<p>So we mounted the sensing units and established a couple of security cameras, along with a video doorbell camera to see how well it secured our home.
