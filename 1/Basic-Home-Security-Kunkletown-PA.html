Throughout the 1990s through 2004, when alarm ownership experienced a high increase, other kinds of crime decreased just as sharply as burglary, suggesting that aspects besides a boost in the variety of alarm systems fueled the burglary decrease.</p>
<p>The prospective value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators determined the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images caught by the city's cameras. Since we understand all the ins and outs of Ring Alarm, we suggest the 8-piece security kit as the very best method to take full advantage of Ring's cost effective home security alternatives.
