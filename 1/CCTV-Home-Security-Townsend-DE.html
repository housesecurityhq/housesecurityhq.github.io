<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
