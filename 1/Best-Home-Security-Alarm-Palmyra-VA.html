<p>Not all security cameras work in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that enables more light to go into the camera's sensor. The more light that is allowed to enter the camera the brighter the image will be. Nevertheless, even these low light capable cameras have digital sound that make the dark image appearance fuzzy.

Responding to incorrect alarms can unnecessarily cost Sumner - and its taxpayers - cash each year. In addition, officers reacting to these false alarms are unable to respond to real emergency situations or perform preventative patrols.</p>
