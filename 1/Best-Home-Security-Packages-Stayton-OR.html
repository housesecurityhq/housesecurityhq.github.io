<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. If you're trying to find motion detection, the Canary Flex features an intelligent variation that sends informs straight to your phone. This camera uses a wide range of functions including a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as extremely middle of the roadway. Not great, not terrible, but with a truly simple setup process (and trust me, that actually is a killer function when it comes to smart cameras.) This more recent variation is much the same, to be frank.</p>

<h3>Home Security - Protect Your Home with Dummy Security Cameras in Stayton</h3>
