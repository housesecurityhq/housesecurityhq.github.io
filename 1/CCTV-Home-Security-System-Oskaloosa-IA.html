Piza and coworkers (2019) conducted a new review of the literature to update a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that looked at the impacts of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance on criminal activity prevention. The researchers looked for CCTV evaluations published in between 2007 and 2017 to account for the period given that the last evaluation (which covered examinations finished in 2006 and earlier). Techniques included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV evaluation study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and contacting leading scientists to ask about upcoming assessments. Both published and unpublished reports were consisted of in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was worldwide in scope.</p>

<p>So we mounted the sensing units and set up a few security cameras, in addition to a video doorbell camera to see how well it protected our home.
