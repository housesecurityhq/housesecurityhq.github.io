I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
