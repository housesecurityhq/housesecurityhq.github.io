<h4>Security Alarm Installation Montgomery 77356</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further problems, 2 weeks later a new specialist was sent who suggested there would be considerable service charges to complete the installation.</p>
