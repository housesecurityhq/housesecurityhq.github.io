<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>

However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.
