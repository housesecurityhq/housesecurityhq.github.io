<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. The loudest of the clever alarm we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at cautioning anybody in your house and those neighboring that there's a problem.

We checked Somfy's more expensive system, which featured a wifi security camera, however more economical packages are likewise offered.
