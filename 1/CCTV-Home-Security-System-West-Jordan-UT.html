<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
