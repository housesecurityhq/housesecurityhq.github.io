The previous, less expensive version of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have a cable connected however, instead of working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit much easier to mess up for potential trespassers. Definitely one of the best security cameras in 2020.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor.

However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
