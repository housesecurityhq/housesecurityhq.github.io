<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
