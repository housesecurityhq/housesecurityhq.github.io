When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
