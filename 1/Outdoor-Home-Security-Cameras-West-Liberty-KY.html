<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
