<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
