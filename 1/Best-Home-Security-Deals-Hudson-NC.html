<p>The Kasa Webcam Outdoor is a good well-rounded weatherproof home security camera that costs less than $100. However, there are a couple of tradeoffs with this camera. Unlike other outdoor cameras on this list, the Kasa Camera needs to be plugged in to an outlet to get power, and while the camera is weather-resistant, the connection between its cable television and power supply is not.</p>
<p>For some, that might deserve the $300 price tag. However while we like the clever functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Webcam IQ, a number of the cameras we took a look at deal the exact same perks at a more affordable cost. Make sure to consider how your camera will continue to get power throughout a blackout.
