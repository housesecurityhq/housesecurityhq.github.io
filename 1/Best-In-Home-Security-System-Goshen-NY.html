<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
