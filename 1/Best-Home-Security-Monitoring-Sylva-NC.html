Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>When it pertains to installation, it's best to have a professional handle this job. Vivint is a professionally-installed and monitored  home security system with a home automation platform.
