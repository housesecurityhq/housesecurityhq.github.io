<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
