<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". Equipment consists of things like your door and window sensors, motion sensing units, control board, and so on. The cost completely depends on which provider you choose, however expect to pay a couple of hundred dollars for a basic package--$ 200 would be considered cheap for a starter pack of home security equipment. That said, it can run more affordable if you choose a company that runs a great deal of offers on equipment (like Frontpoint).</p>
<p>Door and window sensors are contact motion sensors that activate an alarm when the secured door or window opens. Like stand-alone motion detectors, these can trigger when you're far from home or whenever you choose. For instance, you may keep the window sensors constantly activated but shut off the door sensing units when you're at home. These sensors can work as part of your security system or by themselves, and they vary in size and style from tiny, sleek sensing units to bulky and apparent. Sensors also vary in level of sensitivity. Some may trigger when the door or window vibrates versus actually opening.</p>

If you wish to avoid having to sign an agreement, we would suggest thinking about a Do It Yourself home security system rather.</p>
