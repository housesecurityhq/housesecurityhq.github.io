<p>I have this camera connected to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights at night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.
