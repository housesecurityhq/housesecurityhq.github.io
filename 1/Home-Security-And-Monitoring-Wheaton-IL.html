<p>First and foremost, it's hard to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's better than a lot of cameras that are four times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after practically two years of night, use and day images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we experienced when checking the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We've seen it highlight moths, mice, and automobiles.</p>

<p>The Wyze Web cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security choice (although we loved it as a pet camera ). It has since been enhanced and now equals our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home combination choices. We value that the company continues to repeat and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of view, and Wyze says it plans to do away with person detection, a minimum of momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
