<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
