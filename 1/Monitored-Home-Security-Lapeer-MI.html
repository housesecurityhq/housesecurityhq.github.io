<h4>Security Alarm System Lapeer 48446</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single service technician got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The manager got to 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following further grievances, 2 weeks later a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be substantial added fees to complete the installation.</p>
