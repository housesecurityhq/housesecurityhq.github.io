When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
