<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
