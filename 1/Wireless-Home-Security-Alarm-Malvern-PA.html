<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. They might claim your security company has failed, that they've taken control of the accounts, and that you have to buy new equipment and sign new contracts.

<p>A subsidiary of Amazon, Ring's Alarm security package is quick to install and easy to utilize. Aside from a new "Works with Ring" program to bring suitable wise locks and other third-party devices into the fold, there's absolutely nothing all that innovative about it, though Amazon Alexa users will appreciate the two-way voice feature, that they can arm and deactivate the system using voice commands which they can use Ring's sensors to set off Amazon Alexa routines.</p>
