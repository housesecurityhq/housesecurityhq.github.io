<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
