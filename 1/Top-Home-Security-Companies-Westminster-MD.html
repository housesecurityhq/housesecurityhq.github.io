Likewise upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following more problems, 2 weeks later on a new technician was sent who indicated there would be substantial surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
