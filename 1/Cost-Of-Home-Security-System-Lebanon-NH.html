<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
