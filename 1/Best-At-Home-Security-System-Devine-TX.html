<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
