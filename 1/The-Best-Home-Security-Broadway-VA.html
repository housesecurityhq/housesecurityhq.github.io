<p>On the installation date, a single service technician got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Also disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had recently undergone comprehensive background checks.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
