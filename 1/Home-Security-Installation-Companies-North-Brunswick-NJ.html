<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras reduce criminal activity. There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving things if it identifies an intruder; an useful intercom function that allows the gadget to act as a wise doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, since Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>
<p>A few minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply would not link. An assistance window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint associate helped her troubleshoot the connection.
