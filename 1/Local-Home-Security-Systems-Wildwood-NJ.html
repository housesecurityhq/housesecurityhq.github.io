The loudest of the clever alarm systems we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at alerting anybody in your house and those close-by that there's an issue. During screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we enjoy that the sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be gotten used to represent family pets, too. The alarm system is just one of two we tested that includes an external siren, and we're pleased that it also comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further preventing anyone from trying to break in to your property.
