The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notifications (and recording, because it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting eight times over 2 months.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Cops Department and the Village frequently receive demands to waive false alarm fees. By ordinance, only false alarms brought on by hurricanes, twisters, earthquake or other disastrous events, are subject to appeal. Alarms activated by electrical storms, thunder, hail, or unexpected modifications in temperature level do not meet the standards for waiver of false alarm charges. Alarms activated by unintentional but legal entry to the home, i.e. kids returning home, guests, neighbors taking care of the home while you are on trip and shipment men do not meet the standard for waiver.</p>
