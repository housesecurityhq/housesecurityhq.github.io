<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
