Because their design allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection. This will offer more precise and less regular informs because many times the motion detection is set off by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
