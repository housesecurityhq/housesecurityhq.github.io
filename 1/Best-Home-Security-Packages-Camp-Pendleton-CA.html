<p>On the installation date, a single professional got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The manager got to 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently gone through thorough background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further problems, two weeks later on a new technician was sent who indicated there would be considerable additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
