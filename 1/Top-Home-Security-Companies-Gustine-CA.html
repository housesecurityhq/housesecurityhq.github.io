Likewise unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The manager got to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently been subjected to extensive background checks.
