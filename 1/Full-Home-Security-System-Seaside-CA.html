<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
