<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems meant to summon authorities department personnel, needs registration, evaluation of costs for extreme false alarm system, supplies procedures for repeat wrongdoers, and provides an effective date. Numerous sensor security cameras are much better for infrared or low-light (you can even target a number of cameras to the same area and capture overlapping video feeds upon different frequencies) and they're better for high resolution over fisheye lenses. Furthermore, in case of damage or blockage to any single sensing unit, a. multi-sensor security camera will keep transmitting where a fisheye or other single sensing unit camera would stop working.</p>
<p>Simply put, the expansion of surveillance cameras has rapidly reduced our capability to preserve anonymity in public spaces; and the introduction of automated face recognition and other tracking innovations just accelerate this hazard to privacy.

We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza.
