<h4>Burglar Alarm Equipment Whitmore Lake 48189</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently gone through extensive background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following additional grievances, 2 weeks later a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be substantial added fees to complete the installation.</p>
