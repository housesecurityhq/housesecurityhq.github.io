<p>The Wyze Web cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be an effective security choice (although we liked it as a family pet web cam ).

<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you desire the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the wise home tech. Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automated door lock and smart thermostat for the cost of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic package if you can't pay for the additional equipment. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay additional for).</p>
