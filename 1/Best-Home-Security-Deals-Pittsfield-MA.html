Honeywell's Do It Yourself security system counts on a device called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top.

ADT provides monitored security packages that are tailored to protect your home. Main features consist of the ability control your home security system from anywhere, set up customized signals, supply live video monitoring (both outside and inside), along with emergency alarms triggered by smoke, co2, or even flooding.</p>
<p>Brinks Home Security systems use a passcode, the Brinks Home Security app, Bluetooth hands-free disarming and an optional keychain remote. Some robberies and attacks happen at night. However the huge bulk occur throughout the day when no one is home. Some burglars break glass to reach in and unlock doors and windows. However the smarter ones don't because they do not want to leave blood DNA at the scene. They 'd rather kick in your door or pry open a window.</p>

<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I remained in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Actually annoying. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, because apparently they vehicle renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, way too expensive, and not terrific.</p>
