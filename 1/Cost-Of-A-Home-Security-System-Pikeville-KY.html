<p>On the installation date, a single professional arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager came to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had just recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks.
