<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
