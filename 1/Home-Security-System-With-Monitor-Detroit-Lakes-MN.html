<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
