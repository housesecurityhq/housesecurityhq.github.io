It uses costs and alarm registration to reduce the variety of false alarms to which the department needs to respond.

<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is necessary. In fact, we don't advise buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to distinguish between a person and a car, for example, enables you to cut down on unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, or perhaps garbage cans.</p>
