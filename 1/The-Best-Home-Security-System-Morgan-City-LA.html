<p>While it hits the resolution, we presume there's a little interpolation on its 4K video footage considered that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, but this is still far and away the sharpest security camera we've seen in action, wireless or otherwise. In cities with low burglary rates, security systems with less components and without expert monitoring are more viable alternatives.

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it because its battery-saving routines can disrupt performance.</p>
