<p>The Nest Web cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription design and same app as the original Nest Web cam Outdoor, however it adds in more-detailed individual detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking feature (which follows an individual around the seeing location), better audio, a stronger mount, and a broader operating temperature range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. If catching video in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>

In cities with low break-in rates, security systems with less elements and without expert monitoring are more feasible alternatives. Those living in cities with higher criminal offense rates might wish to get the very best possible equipment and monitoring due to the greater chance of being broken into.</p>

However, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the customer.</p>
