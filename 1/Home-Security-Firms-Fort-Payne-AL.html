<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus scams, theft, and vandalism. A wireless home security system uses a radio frequency to communicate with the control panel and sensing units. The control panel then interacts with a monitoring center using a cellular signal. And, if you have a camera, the video recordings are sent to a receiver that's linked to your local or cloud storage. This package gives you the chance to try clever control, but does not use a huge quantity by itself. However, combined with the suitable locks, sensors, alarms and web cams, you can create a seriously secure home.</p>
