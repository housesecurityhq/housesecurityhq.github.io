<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus scams, theft, and vandalism. A wireless home security system uses a radio frequency to communicate with the control panel and sensing units. The control panel then interacts with a monitoring center using a cellular signal. And, if you have a camera, the video recordings are sent to a receiver that's linked to your local or cloud storage. This package gives you the chance to try clever control, but does not use a huge quantity by itself. However, combined with the suitable locks, sensors, alarms and web cams, you can create a seriously secure home.</p>

<p>So we installed the sensing units and set up a few security cameras, along with a video doorbell camera to see how well it protected our home. The results weren't exactly glowing, however we believed the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras provided crisp video, and the home automation-- well, there actually wasn't much in the automation department.
