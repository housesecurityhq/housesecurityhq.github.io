<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had just recently gone through extensive background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following further complaints, 2 weeks later on a new professional was sent who suggested there would be significant additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
