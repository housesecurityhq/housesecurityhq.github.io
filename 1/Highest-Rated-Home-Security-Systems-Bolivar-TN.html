<p>The Douglas County Burglar Alarm Regulation provides a fair service to a challenging problem: managing our law enforcement assets to provide superior police services. There are reports of brief battery life on Ring products (some say it lasts about a month), and recharging the Stick Up Camera is a tiresome procedure because you need to remove the battery each time.

Read our Ring Alarm evaluation to see how Ring products all work together.</p>
<p>A couple of minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply wouldn't connect. A help window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint representative helped her troubleshoot the connection.

Certainly not perfect-- however the associate asked forgiveness and shipped her replacement control board overnight.</p>

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space.
