I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
