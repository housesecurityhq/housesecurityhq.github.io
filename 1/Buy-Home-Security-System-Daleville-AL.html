<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
