I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
