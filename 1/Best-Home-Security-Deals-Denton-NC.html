It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
