<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
<p>If you have just recently moved into a house in Deerfield and the home was formerly wired for an alarm, please make sure that the system is inactive.

Applications for alarm permits are available at the Police headquarters. Please contact the Cops Department for an Alarm License Application if you are setting up a new alarm. The alarm company must also be registered by the State of Illinois.</p>
