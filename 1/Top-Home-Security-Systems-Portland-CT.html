<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

<p>Seeing angle: The camera's field of vision determines just how much it can see. As you're probably monitoring a single room, you want a wide seeing angle. Many current cameras fall in the 130-degree range.
