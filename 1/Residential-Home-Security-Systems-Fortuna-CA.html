No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
