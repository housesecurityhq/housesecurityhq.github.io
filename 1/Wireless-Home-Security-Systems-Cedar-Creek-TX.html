Once a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line.

It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.
