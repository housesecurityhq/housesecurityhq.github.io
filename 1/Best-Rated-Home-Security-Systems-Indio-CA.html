<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control panel (usually positioned in the entrance hall) that is utilized to equip and deactivate the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have actually been set off, smart alarms are managed from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and alerts you if any of the sensors have been triggered, instead of getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially bothersome your neighbours). However, smart alarms do need a hub that enables the different components to wirelessly connect. But for many clever alarms this hub can be placed throughout your home.</p>
