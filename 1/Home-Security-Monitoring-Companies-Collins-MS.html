And that's what Nest provides you.</p>

Customers get the choice of 12, 24, and 36 month contracts, or a pay-as-you-go choice.

We still like Vivint's basic bundle if you can't manage the additional equipment. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
