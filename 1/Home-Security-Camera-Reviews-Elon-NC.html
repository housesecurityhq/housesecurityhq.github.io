To see that video, you can utilize an app on your phone or a web browser link on your computer.</p>
<p>Another essential subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image.

When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some tricky consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
