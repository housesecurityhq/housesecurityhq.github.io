<p>Figure 1-1 depicts an example of a CCTV installation that keeps an eye on select locations of protection. The first installation was created and developed for the separate parking center. This implementation included a number of set position cameras on each flooring of the parking garage, stairwells, and exits, all connected straight to a primary control system (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is an easy gadget for handling the input and output of video feeds through the coax cables. Secondary utilities and devices can provide easy integration of some alarms, however this technology has limited abilities and an intricate combination procedure.</p>
<p>Many monitoring companies will initially reach out to you so that they can understand if the alarm was real or if it was an accident.

In my view it is the best security system with low cost of ownership. If agreement plans don't attract you, think about Blue by ADT, which provides DIY installation and self-monitoring.
