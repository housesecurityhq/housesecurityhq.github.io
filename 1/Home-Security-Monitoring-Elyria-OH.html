<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the very first couple of months. Many insurance companies provide discount rates on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments use several "complimentary" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is significant right from the start. The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers call into question the appropriateness of the current pattern in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, since they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
