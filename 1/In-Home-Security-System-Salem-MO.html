<p>On the installation date, a single professional arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor reached 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following further complaints, two weeks later a new service technician was sent who showed there would be considerable surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
