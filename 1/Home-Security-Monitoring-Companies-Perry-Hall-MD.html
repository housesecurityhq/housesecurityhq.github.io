Basically you rent to own a wireless security system.</p>
<p>The primary downsides of Armorex are its ever-shifting rates structure and insufficient consumer support. Not a lot of information is included on the website about methods of tech support.

<p>Likewise called point-to-point, this kind of wireless installation is ideal if your application has another structure unit on the properties, such as on a school or rural plot of land. Vivint Ping Camera provides you one-way video, two-way talk, and one-touch callout to help keep an eye on visitors, kids, senior parents, or animals when you're out.

<p>The biggest disadvantage of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets set off while you're away, you have no visual ways of verifying if something is really wrong and how major the scenario is. If the alarm incident is determined to be a false alarm, the city will send by mail a billing summing up the occurrence and examining a fee, if any.</p>
