<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system.
