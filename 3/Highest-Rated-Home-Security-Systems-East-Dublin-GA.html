<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager got to 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently undergone extensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more grievances, 2 weeks later a new professional was sent who indicated there would be considerable service charges to complete the installation.</p>
