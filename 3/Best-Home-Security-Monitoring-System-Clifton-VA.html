<p>IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out information from the camera and supplies power to it.

You need to do the exact same thing with all your gadgets that are utilizing Ethernet cable televisions or when you will not be at home.</p>
