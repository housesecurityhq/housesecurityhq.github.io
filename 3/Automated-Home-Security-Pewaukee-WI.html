That said, ADT is the best known brand name in the industry for a factor, and their exceptional equipment and monitoring service tend to justify the greater price for numerous house owners.

<p>Frontpoint offers five packages and 2 monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester went with the Interactive plan but ended up discontented with its lack of live video surveillance.

<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera also works as a motion detector. It is equipped with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor, so whenever there's some motion spotted, it can send you a push alert in your phone so you can react to it instantly.
