<h4>Wireless Alarm Companies Saluda 29138</h4>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
