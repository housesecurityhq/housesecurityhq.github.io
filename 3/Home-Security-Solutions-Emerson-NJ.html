<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Numerous insurance companies provide discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments use a number of "totally free" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, although the cost to react is substantial right from the start. The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four totally free false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>

<h3>Easy Remote Viewing of a Home Security Video Surveillance Alarm in Emerson</h3>
