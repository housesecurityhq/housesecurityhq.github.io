The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four totally free false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
