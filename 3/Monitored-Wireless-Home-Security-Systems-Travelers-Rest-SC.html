<p>All About Security offers expert, trustworthy alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the higher Indianapolis area. The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
