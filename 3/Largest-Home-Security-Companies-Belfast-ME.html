<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the specific very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which indicates. If someone were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm.
