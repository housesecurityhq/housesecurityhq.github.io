<p>No pressure choice: An expertly monitored system often comes with a duress PIN. The property owner can turn off the alarm using the pressure PIN if an intruder requires a property owner to disarm the system.

Such systems are more easily hackable" than a closed circuit system and the issues over cyber security only continues to grow.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
