No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
