<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Truly frustrating. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, since obviously they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a headache, way too costly, and not great.</p>
