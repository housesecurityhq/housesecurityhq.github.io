The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
