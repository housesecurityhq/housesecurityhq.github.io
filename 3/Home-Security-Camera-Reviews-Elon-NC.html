<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake.

In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more grievances, two weeks later on a new professional was sent who showed there would be substantial surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
