This appearance is recognizable to almost everyone and thus serves as a deterrent to unwanted individuals. If security cameras show up, the hope is bad guys and trespassers go elsewhere rather. That being said, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism since of their obvious appearance. Additionally, the shape of the camera is perfect for concentrating on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but requires several cameras if a user requires to see several set views. Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work inside your home or outdoors. They include a small lip on completion of the camera that adds weather condition protection and reduces glare.</p>

Structure on what the Arlo Pro 2 offers, the Arlo Pro 3 deals QHD HDR video, complete weatherproofing (so you can stick it outside), an impressive 160-degree watching angle, and even colour night vision - so your low light shots will be in colour instead of rough black and white.</p>
