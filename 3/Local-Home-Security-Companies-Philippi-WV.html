<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
