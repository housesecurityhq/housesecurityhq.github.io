When a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. The quantity and quality of data kept on storage media undergoes compression ratios, images saved per 2nd, image size and is effected by the retention duration of the images or videos. 123 DVRs keep images in a range of exclusive file formats Recordings may be maintained for a predetermined amount of time and then automatically archived, overwritten or erased, the period being identified by the organisation that created them.</p>
