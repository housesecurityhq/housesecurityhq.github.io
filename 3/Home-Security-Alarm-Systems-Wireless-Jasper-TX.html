<p>All About Security provides professional, dependable alarm monitoring services for homes and organisations throughout the greater Indianapolis area. We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

<h3>Security Camera - Surveillance Camera Systems For Home And Office in Jasper TX 75951</h3>
<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
