<h3>Hidden Security Cameras Vs Overt Surveillance Cameras in Gainesville</h3>
<p>Not all security cameras work in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light capabilities have a shutter that allows more light to go into the camera's sensing unit. The more light that is allowed to enter the camera the brighter the image will be. Nevertheless, even these low light capable cameras have digital sound that make the dark image appearance fuzzy. To combat this fuzzy image some security cameras come geared up with 2D and 3D digital noise reduction Some security cameras now feature infrared light that is undetectable to the human eye but can be gotten by a security camera's sensing unit.</p>
<p>An NVR makes it easy to record video surveillance footage, but you will require linked hard disk drives on which to keep this video footage.
