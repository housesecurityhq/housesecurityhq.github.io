<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
