<p>On the installation date, a single service technician arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The manager got to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently gone through thorough background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following more problems, 2 weeks later a new service technician was sent who showed there would be considerable surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
