<p>The Abode Smart Security Package, our previous runner-up, is still a solid choice for some people. Abode has updated that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which supplies a much better range for sensing units. Both the original Home system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we evaluated that also deals with HomeKit. We've come across a few technical issues while long-lasting screening the Abode Iota, therefore will continue to check and update appropriately. We no longer recommend it.</p>
<p>Unlike wired security systems, wireless systems allow for on-the-go" monitoring of your system from a cellular phone - anytime, anywhere.
