<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
