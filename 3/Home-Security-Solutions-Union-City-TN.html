<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need extra cables. DVR systems are hard to scale up since once every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you require to purchase an entirely new DVR before adding another camera to the system.
