<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
