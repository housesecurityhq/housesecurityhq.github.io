<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had just recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further problems, two weeks later a new specialist was sent who suggested there would be significant surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
