I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal building and construction.
