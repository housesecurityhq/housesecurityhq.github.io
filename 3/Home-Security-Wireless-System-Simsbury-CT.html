<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
