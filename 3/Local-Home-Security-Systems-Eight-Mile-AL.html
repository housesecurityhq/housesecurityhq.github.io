<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level.

HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
