<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level.
