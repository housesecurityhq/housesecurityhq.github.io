<p>Frontpoint offers 5 packages and two monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester opted for the Interactive strategy but ended up disappointed with its absence of live video surveillance. When she received an alarm notice while on holiday, she had no other way of determining whether her home had actually been gotten into or if her feline had managed to journey the sensing unit. It ended up being an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
<p>When the alarm is tripped, an on-site ringer will usually trigger a bell or siren connected to the building. Likewise, when an automatic dialer alarm is tripped, a phone conversation is instantly put to the authorities or fire departments, and a pre-recorded announcement is played when that call is addressed. Automatic dialer alarms are not allowed to dial 9-1-1.</p>
