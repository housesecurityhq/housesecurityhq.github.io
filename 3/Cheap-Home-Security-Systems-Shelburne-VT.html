<p>Seeing angle: The camera's field of vision determines how much it can see. As you're most likely monitoring a single room, you desire a wide seeing angle. Most current cameras fall in the 130-degree range.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
