<p>This cool wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. Throughout screening, we discovered it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when motion was identified. We like that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector.
