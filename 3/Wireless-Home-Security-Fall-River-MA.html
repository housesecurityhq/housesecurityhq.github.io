<h4>Security System Installation Fall River 02720</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor got to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following further grievances, two weeks later on a new professional was sent who showed there would be significant added fees to complete the installation.</p>
