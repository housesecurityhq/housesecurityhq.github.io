<p>Like any item that links to the internet and utilizes wireless technology, smart home security systems are vulnerable to hacking, especially systems that lack file encryption.

Other devices enable hackers to generate radio sound that can jam interactions in between the sensing units and the hub.</p>

<p>Analogue signals can also be transformed into a digital signal to make it possible for the recordings to be stored on a PC as digital recordings In that case the analogue video camera should be plugged straight into a video capture card in the computer, and the card then transforms the analogue signal to digital. These cards are fairly cheap, however undoubtedly the resulting digital signals are compressed 5:1 (MPEG compression) in order for the video recordings to be saved money on a continuous basis.</p>
