The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers bring into question the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of permitting three or 4 totally free incorrect alarms per calendar year, since they provide no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
