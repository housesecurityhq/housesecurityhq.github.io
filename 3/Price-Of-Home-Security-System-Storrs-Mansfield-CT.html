<p>Everything about Security offers professional, trusted alarm monitoring services for homes and businesses throughout the higher Indianapolis location. We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it ought to be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for one month.
