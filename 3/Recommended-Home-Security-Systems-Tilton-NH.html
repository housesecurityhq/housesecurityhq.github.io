It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment prices is super affordable, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you want the best of everything, you'll desire Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and wise thermostat for the rate of equipment and $10 additional a month. If you can't manage the additional equipment, we still like Vivint's basic plan. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay additional for).</p>
