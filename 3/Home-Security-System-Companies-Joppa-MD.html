<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're truly suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>

At the same time, look for a camera that offers a cloud storage plan.</p>

<p>Another element to think about is security, a wireless connection is rather simple for hackers to access.
