A couple of designs utilize batteries, making placement more flexible, however this needs other compromises, which we highlight in the Competitors area.

(For a take a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for The Majority Of People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your smart device or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to install the camera, you likely will not have an issue.</p>
