<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
