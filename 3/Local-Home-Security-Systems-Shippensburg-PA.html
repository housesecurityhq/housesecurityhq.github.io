I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
