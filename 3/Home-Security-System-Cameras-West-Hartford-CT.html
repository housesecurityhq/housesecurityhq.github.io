<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing benefit, peace of mind and complete satisfaction to every customer and are devoted to fulfilling our consumer's needs with integrity, sincerity, enthusiasm and outstanding service. As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly attempted to give it an attractive edge, and we have to give credit to its ability to reveal what's going on from as much as four cameras at a time. It can be uncomfortable and slow to use on event - with the procedure of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid sometimes. The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you want to save some money - it does have a cable attached though, rather than working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit much easier to sabotage for possible burglars. Definitely one of the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>

Nevertheless, after almost 2 years of night, day and usage images have always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we experienced when testing the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion detected. We've seen it highlight mice, moths, and cars.</p>
