Like stand-alone motion detectors, these can trigger when you're away from home or whenever you choose. For example, you might keep the window sensing units constantly activated but deactivate the door sensors when you're at home. These sensors can work as part of your security system or on their own, and they vary in size and style from tiny, sleek sensing units to obvious and large. Sensors also vary in level of sensitivity. Some may set off when the door or window vibrates versus in fact opening.</p>

<p>Cameras frequently transmit video over the Internet, enabling operators to monitor security camera feeds remotely. In many cases, surveillance systems are spent for and operated by the cities themselves.
