<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. The Canary Flex features an intelligent variation that sends out signals straight to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera uses a wide range of features consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I examined a Swann camera I described it as distinctly middle of the roadway. Not terrific, not dreadful, but with a really simple setup procedure (and trust me, that really is a killer feature when it comes to wise cameras.) This newer version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
<p>That stated, we truly liked Brinks' straightforward package choices.
