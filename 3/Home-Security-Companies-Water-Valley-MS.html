<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
