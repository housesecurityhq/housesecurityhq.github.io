<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
