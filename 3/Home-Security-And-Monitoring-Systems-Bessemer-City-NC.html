These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
