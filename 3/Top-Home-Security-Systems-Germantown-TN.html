<h2>Wireless Home Security Systems With Monitoring in Germantown Tennessee</h2>

<p>Another essential subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much is enough.

The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much photo info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

We would recommend considering a DIY home security system instead if you want to avoid having to sign an agreement.</p>
