<p>As explained by Cornish and Clarke (2003 ), CCTV is a type of formal surveillance," indicating that not only does CCTV have the capability to take the place of cops or security officers but CCTV can also enhance officers' abilities (Welsh and Farrington 2008). In addition to operating as a deterrent, cameras can inform authorities of crimes as they occur, which can make it possible for officers to respond quickly and effectively (La Vigne et al. 2011).
