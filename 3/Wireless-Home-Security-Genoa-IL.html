In this case, the business owner ends up having a well-exposed doorway, though an indoor image that is too dark to be usable. On the other hand, the face of the person strolling into the store is never ever recorded because they are standing in the under-exposed shop.

The argument is that anybody can sniff the traffic applies to wired networks too, where system administrators and possible hackers have access to the links and can check out the traffic. Also, anyone knowing the keys for an encrypted wireless network can access to the information being moved over the network.</p>
