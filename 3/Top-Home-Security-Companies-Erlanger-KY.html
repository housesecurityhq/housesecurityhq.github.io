<p>The security systems I have actually created and executed are strictly for monitoring activity of a prospective target, whether from a terrorist hazard or community thieves or vandals. The systems are released for the protection of lives and home and not to enjoy individuals as they jaywalk throughout the street or run a traffic signal (which both are, by the method, against the law). Those are different solutions with different requirements and objectives.</p>
