<h4>Security Home Alarm System Heber 92249</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor got to 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks.
