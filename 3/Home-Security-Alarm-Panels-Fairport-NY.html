No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal construction.

Must be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
