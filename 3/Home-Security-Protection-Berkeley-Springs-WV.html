<p>The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter alerts, for example. However, those functions come at a comparatively steep price: $5 each month ($50 annually) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 per year) for one month of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the initial charge.
