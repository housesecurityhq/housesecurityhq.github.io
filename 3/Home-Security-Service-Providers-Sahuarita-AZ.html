<p>All individuals with alarm protecting a property in the City of Fredericksburg must have a legitimate alarm license. Last, we likewise consider just how much it costs to view, share and save tape-recorded video.

So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Truly frustrating. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that apparently they auto restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a headache, way too pricey, and not excellent.</p>
