<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is use any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system.

In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if needed, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
