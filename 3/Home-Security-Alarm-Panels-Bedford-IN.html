<h4>The Best Security System Bedford 47421</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had just recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following additional complaints, two weeks later on a new service technician was sent who indicated there would be considerable service charges to complete the installation.</p>
