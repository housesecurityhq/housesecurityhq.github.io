Outdoor cameras will typically be built to be more resilient and able to survive rain, frost, or damp. The downside of outdoor cameras is that they're usually mains powered and need expert installation. Thankfully, I have actually checked out lots of cameras and condensed everything I have actually found out into the list below.
