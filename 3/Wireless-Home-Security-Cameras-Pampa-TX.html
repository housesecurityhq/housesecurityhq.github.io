<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
