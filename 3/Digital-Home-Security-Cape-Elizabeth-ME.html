Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
