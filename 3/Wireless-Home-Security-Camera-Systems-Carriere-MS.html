No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
