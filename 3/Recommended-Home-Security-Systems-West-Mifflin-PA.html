<h2>Home Security Packages in West Mifflin Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>If there's one company challenging ADT's lawn sign monopoly, it's Xfinity Home Security The multi-platform company first delved into home security in 2011, and its signature red yard indication is almost as common as ADT's timeless blue. The best factor to go with Xfinity may be that you're already a Comcast consumer. Bundling opens the door for deals, and makes your regular monthly expense paying that much easier.
