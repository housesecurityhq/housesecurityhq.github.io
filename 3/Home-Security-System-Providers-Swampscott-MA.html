It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment rates is extremely affordable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
