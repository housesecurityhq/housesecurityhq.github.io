<p>After checking dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is incredibly reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

In that case, the cost of purchasing each piece-- cameras, thermostat, center, door locks-- will start to add up, with a couple of hundred dollars here and there, but you will not have to maintain regular monthly monitoring expenses.</p>
