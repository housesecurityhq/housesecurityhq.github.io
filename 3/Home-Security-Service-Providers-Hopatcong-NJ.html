<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if needed, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
