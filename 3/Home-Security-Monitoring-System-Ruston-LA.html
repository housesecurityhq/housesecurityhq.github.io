I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

Moreover, it doesn't get activated by small items. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has one of the most advanced motion sensing units that get rid of all false alarms and just gets triggered when individuals approach it.</p>
