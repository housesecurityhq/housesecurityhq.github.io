<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some parts might be affected temporarily by a power interruption, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical energy. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours till the electric service is brought back. Landline systems use traditional phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, much like cellular systems, they normally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set amount of time.</p>
<p>Our experience with professional installation was mixed. Our tester stated the professional offered strong customer care: He dropped a few unnecessary window sensors from my expense after choosing that the motion detector sufficed for the entire front half of my home." Nevertheless, there were some issues with connecting the command center to our tester's network.</p>
