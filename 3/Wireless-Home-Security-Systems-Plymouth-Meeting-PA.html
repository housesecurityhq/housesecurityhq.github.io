<p>A societal consensus about how cameras need to be utilized is important, but in the end we are a country of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the Fourth Change to the United States Constitution provides some protection against video searches conducted by the authorities, there are currently no general, legally enforceable rules to restrict privacy invasions and protect against abuse of CCTV systems. Rules are needed to establish a clear public understanding of such problems as whether video signals are recorded, under what conditions, and the length of time are they kept; what the requirements are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be confirmed and imposed; and what punishments would use to lawbreakers.</p>

<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The manager came to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further problems, 2 weeks later a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be substantial service charges to complete the installation.</p>
