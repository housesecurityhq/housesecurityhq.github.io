<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that enables more light to go into the camera's sensor. The more light that is enabled to go into the camera the brighter the image will be. However, even these low light capable cameras have digital sound that make the dark image look fuzzy. To fight this fuzzy image some security cameras come geared up with 2D and 3D digital noise reduction Some security cameras now include infrared light that is invisible to the human eye but can be gotten by a security camera's sensor.</p>
<p>Exits and Entrances - Security cameras placed at the entrances and exits to your business will track not just who enters your business, but the length of time they stay. The exact placement near the entryway and exit is essential also. Attempt to install the camera near a sign or other appealing feature where most people will look as they go into or exit the building. This will increase the chance of capturing a full photo of each person's face.</p>

<p>No. Self-monitoring doesn't mean Do It Yourself installation. There are numerous companies that use self-monitoring and professional installation.
