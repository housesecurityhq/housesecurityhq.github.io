<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more complaints, 2 weeks later on a new professional was sent who indicated there would be significant added fees to finish the installation.</p>
