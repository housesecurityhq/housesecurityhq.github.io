<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
