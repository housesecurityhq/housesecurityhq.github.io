Every brand name declares to use high resolution and night vision, and arranging through the claims can be complicated.</p>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
