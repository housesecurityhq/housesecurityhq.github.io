I disconnectedit, reset it to factory default, and added it back to the Zmodo App. It is currently working fine.

<p>Some individuals may say that we should not have surveillance cameras in public places. They declare that they get into privacy.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger area and for that reason uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
