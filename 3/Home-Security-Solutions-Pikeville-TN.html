Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automatic home devices are by their very nature wireless, and the majority of home security companies offer a home automation bundle with an app to from another location manage whatever on the system. That isn't to say that you can't have wired home automation, since you can, but automated equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and more difficult to encrypt. It isn't really wise. Wireless gadgets communicate more safely and faster to other devices on the system and to the monitoring center (if you select monitoring).</p>
