<p>Our alarm systems might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation. When a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
