<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without problem. The IR lights at night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
