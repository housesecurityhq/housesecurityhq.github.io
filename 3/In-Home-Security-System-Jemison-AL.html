<p>The Logi Circle 2 is among the most enjoyable of our best security cameras 2020 list: it's a bit like the home monitoring equivalent of a Fitbit. For example, it preps "day brief" videos that reveal a sped-up variation of the day's action of the day (so you don't need to sort through reams of video of the tiniest motion). Since ADT works with third-party dealers to sell and install equipment, your customer service experience might deviate a bit, depending upon what dealer you end up dealing with.

<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we liked it as a pet web cam ). It has since been improved and now rivals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home combination alternatives. We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other picks, it has a minimal field of view, and Wyze says it plans to do away with person detection, a minimum of temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
