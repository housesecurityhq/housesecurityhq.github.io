The sound may frighten off would-be trespassers-- if you're lucky if your system equipment includes an audible alarm. However the cops won't come until you personally call them.</p>
<p>Recording the footage from your security cameras requires hard disk drives or cloud based storage. The digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are connected to has a hard drive inside of it if you have an analog security camera system. If your dealing with recorded video storage on an IP camera system, then your network video recorder (NVR) can use disk drives for on-site recording and cloud-based recording in the event of disk drive breakdown.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras send lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR transforms the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and after that shops it on a hard drive for later retrieval. Displays can be linked to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
