Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to disregard things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.
