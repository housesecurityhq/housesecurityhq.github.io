Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
