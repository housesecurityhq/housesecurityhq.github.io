<h4>Alarm Camera Security System Reading 01867</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently gone through extensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more grievances, two weeks later a new specialist was sent who suggested there would be substantial additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, but you'll pay a bit more if you want to add extra features, like a security camera. While a typical contract runs 42 months (one of the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to rent their equipment. Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>During the spring and summertime, home security or alarm companies hire traveling sales agents to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "cold calls" on homeowners. In many cases, the salesmen use high-pressure or misleading sales methods to get potential customers to buy costly, and sometimes substandard, systems or equipment they do not require.</p>
