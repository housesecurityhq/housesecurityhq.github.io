It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
