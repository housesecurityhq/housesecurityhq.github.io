Thankfully, security system producers appear to have caught on to this concern and resolved it through wireless security cameras.

For instance, you can have a wise plug turn on a light inside or trigger an external siren when the camera discovers motion.</p>
<p>Frame rate: This is another crucial aspect of a camera-- the higher the frame rate, the smoother the video. Video is simply a series of still images sewn together to create a movie. The lower the frame rate, the less often a still is taken; this leads to choppier footage. You'll want to think about the frame rate of the camera you buy before deciding. For reference, "real time" is generally determined as 30 frames per second.</p>
