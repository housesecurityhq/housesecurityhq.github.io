<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a variety of companies provide "free monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Lots of insurance companies offer discounts on insurance coverage premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments offer numerous "complimentary" false alarms before enforcing any fine, even though the cost to react is significant right from the start. The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or four complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
