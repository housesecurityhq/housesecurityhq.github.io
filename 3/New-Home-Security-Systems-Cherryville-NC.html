The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

<p>It needs to be noted that ADT is not known for being the most budget friendly brand.
