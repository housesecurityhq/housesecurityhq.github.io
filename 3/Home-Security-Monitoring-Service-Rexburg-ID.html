<p>As described by Cornish and Clarke (2003 ), CCTV is a kind of official surveillance," suggesting that not only does CCTV have the capability to take the place of police or security officers but CCTV can also enhance officers' abilities (Welsh and Farrington 2008). In addition to working as a deterrent, cameras can notify cops of criminal offenses as they take place, which can allow officers to react rapidly and efficiently (La Vigne et al. 2011). On a bigger scale, the use of CCTV also provides the possibility of assisting in the criminal justice system, as video footage of a crime might assist in investigations and prosecutions (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
