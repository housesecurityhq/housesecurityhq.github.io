<p>When I discuss my deal with homeland security surveillance and physical security innovations, I typically get the Huge Brother is seeing" remark, referring to George Orwell's universal socialistic watcher called Big Bro in his book 1984. This Orwellian" fear is that someone somewhere might be seeing you through a video surveillance camera this very minute which someone someplace is abusing the system to breach your flexibility and personal privacy. Fortunately, you're refraining from doing anything prohibited, simply reading this book, and hopefully not behind the wheel of a trip car, idling in front of a neighborhood bank or terrorist target, or speeding through a traffic signal at a high-risk crossway.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even set off incorrect alarms. False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they happen regularly enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally balanced out by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
