<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
