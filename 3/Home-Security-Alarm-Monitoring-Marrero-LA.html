<h4>Alarm And Camera Security System Marrero 70072</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor got to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following additional grievances, two weeks later a new specialist was sent who suggested there would be significant surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
