<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
