<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
