Brinks uses a variety of third-party combinations to utilize with your home security system including Nest.</p>
<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly fee for a set amount of time, generally one to five years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term plan, are becoming more typical. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount in exchange for that lengthy service arrangement. Spending for the equipment up front supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service.
