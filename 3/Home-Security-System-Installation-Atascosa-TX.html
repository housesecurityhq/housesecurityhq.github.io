I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
