It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
