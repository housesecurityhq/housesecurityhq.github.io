<p>The Wyze Camera v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security option (although we enjoyed it as a family pet webcam ). It has since been improved and now equals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home combination options. We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza.
