<p>So, wired or wireless? In short, the type of security system that you require will depend on what you're searching for. If you're searching for an alarm system that is set up by an installation group and monitored completely by a security company, then the wired system might be the better alternative for you. Both are similarly susceptible to false alarms, so it depends upon your personal choice.</p>
