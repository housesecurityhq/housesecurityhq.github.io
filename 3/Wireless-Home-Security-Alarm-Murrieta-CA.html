I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
