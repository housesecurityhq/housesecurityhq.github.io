<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
