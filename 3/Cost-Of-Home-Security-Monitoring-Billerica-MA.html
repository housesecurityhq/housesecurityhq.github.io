Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

An unmonitored system leaves all the work up to you. That indicates you need to be on night, call and day, during work and trip time, and prepared to identify whether police, fire departments, or other emergency services need to be dispatched.

Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automated door lock and clever thermostat for the cost of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic bundle if you can't manage the extra equipment. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
