<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras minimize criminal activity. There's a couple of other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving items if it identifies an intruder; an useful intercom function that enables the gadget to act as a clever doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>
