<p>On the installation date, a single technician arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor reached 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following more grievances, two weeks later a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be significant added fees to finish the installation.</p>
