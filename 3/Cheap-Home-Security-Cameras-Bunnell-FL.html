<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. If catching video in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>

Cameras exist not to get into an individual's privacy but to secure the general public by discouraging criminal activity and by supplying product evidence when a criminal offense has been captured on movie.</p>
