I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>

Unless you just have one door and one window, you'll require more than the only contact sensing unit that can be found in Ring's five-piece package.</p>
