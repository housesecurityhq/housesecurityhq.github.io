<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
