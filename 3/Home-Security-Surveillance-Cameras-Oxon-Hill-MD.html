<h2>Automated Home Security  in Oxon Hill Maryland</h2>
<p>A social agreement about how cameras need to be used is necessary, but in the end we are a nation of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the Fourth Change to the US Constitution uses some protection versus video searches carried out by the cops, there are currently no general, legally enforceable rules to restrict personal privacy invasions and secure against abuse of CCTV systems. Rules are needed to establish a clear public understanding of such concerns as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and for how long are they maintained; what the requirements are for access to archived video by other federal government companies, or by the public; how the rules would be confirmed and enforced; and what penalties would apply to violators.</p>
<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
