<p>Dual paths allow distinction between hardware failures and a genuine attack on the alarm. This helps remove incorrect alarms and unnecessary reactions. Dual signalling has helped substantially with the restoration of Police action as in an instance where a phone line is cut as the double signalling gadget can continue to send alarm calls through one of its alternative paths either validating or denying the alarm from the initial path.</p>
<p>When the alarm is tripped, an on-site ringer will typically trigger a bell or siren connected to the structure.
