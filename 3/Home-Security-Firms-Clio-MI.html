However, self-monitoring is less effective and less safe than having a security system professionally monitored. Our Basic Video bundle includes both home security and an option of one indoor camera or video doorbell. Wireless technology gives you the flexibility to position cameras practically anywhere, like near doors or other high-traffic areas, so you have a window into activity in and around your home.</p>

<p>However, in any circumstance where standard-definition video cameras are utilized, the quality is going to be poor due to the fact that the optimum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TELEVISION lines but the results are the very same); they normally record vertical and horizontal fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they record; everything within their focus capability is captured.

<p>A clever lock is generally part of a robust smart home security setup, but you don't have to invest in a full-blown system to utilize one.

Alternately, if you don't have a home automation hub, try to find a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that features its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize basic pre-drilled holes and are relatively easy to install. Some designs use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others require that you eliminate your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
