<p>Everything about Security offers expert, trusted alarm monitoring services for homes and organisations throughout the greater Indianapolis location. We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send voice warnings through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you zoom in on the action.

Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they take place frequently enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
