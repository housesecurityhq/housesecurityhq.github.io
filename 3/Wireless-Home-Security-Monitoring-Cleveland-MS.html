<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
